### The author
Hi. I'm some guy on the internet whose story is pretty simple: I liked airplanes and video games as a kid then went to college and took some coding classes. Along the way I worked on some cool projects so I made this website to share them. I believe some of these projects can serve as an inspiration for anyone interested in similar designs. I also started a blog to get stuff out my head and order my thoughts.

### This website 
This website serves as a blog and a repository for my personal projects.  

The __projects__ are sub-divided into multiple categories that branch into their own set of posts. Each project is a set of articles that explain the inception and development of a particular idea until it concludes into a functional prototype. These projects range from small web-apps and Arduino libraries to experimental model aircraft that act as concept demonstrators. The __blog__ follows a similar structure, but focuses on narrating and analyzing experiences. Here you can find things like a travel diary and a research log.

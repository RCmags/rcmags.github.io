### The author
My story is pretty simple: I liked RC-planes and video games as a kid, went to college and took some coding classes, then graduated in mechanical engineering. Along the way, I worked on some cool projects and wanted to share them. I believe some of these projects, especially the model aircraft, can serve as an inspiration for anyone interested in similar designs. I've also started a blog to get stuff out of my head to maintain mental clarity and peace of mind.

### This website 
This website is a repository for personal projects and a blog.  

The __projects__ are sub-divided into multiple categories that branch into their own set of posts. Each project is a set of articles that explain the inception and development of a particular idea until it concludes into a functional prototype. These projects range from small web-apps and Arduino libraries to experimental model aircraft that act as concept demonstrators. The __blog__ follows a similar structure, but focuses on narrating and analyzing experiences. Here you can find things like a travel diary and a research log.

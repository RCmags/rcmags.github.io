Hi I'm Raul. I'm a mechanical engineer that's learned how to program. 
I've gained this skill over time as I enjoy working on electro-mechanical devices.
A lot of this was motivated by my interest unusual radio-controlled aircraft,
although with time I've delved into robotics and this has become it's own motivation.  

Overall, I'm very interested in developing and experimenting with unusual small-scale vehicles. 
They require a combination of mechanics, electronics, and programming that I find very satisfying.

### The author
I'm some guy on the internet that made some cool projects and wanted to share them with the world. I also needed a diary to write down my throughts. Maybe something good will come of it, you know? 

### This website 
This website serves as a blog and a repository for my personal projects.  The __projects__ page is sub-divided into multiple categories that branch into their own set of posts. Each project is a set of articles that explain the inception and development of a particular idea until it concludes into a functional prototype. These projects range from small web-apps and arduino libraries to experimental model aircraft. The __blog__ page follows a similar structure but focuses less structured personal projects and experiences. Here you can find things like a travel diary and a research log.

### The author
I'm some guy on the internet that made a github account to showcase his stuff. My life's story is pretty simple. I liked RC-planes and video games as a kid, then went to college and took some coding classes and got a degree in mechanical engineering. The intersection of these interests led me to make some pretty cool projects and I've felt the need to write about them. I believe that some of these projects, especially the experimental model aircraft, represent some very good and unique concepts. They can definitely serve as inspiration for anyone interested in pursuing similar designs. 

I've also realized I needed a blog to get stuff out of my head. It seems like a good way to maintain mental clarity and peace of mind.

### About this site 
This website is a repository for my projects and a place to keep a blog.  

The projects are sub-divided into multiple categories that branch into their own set of posts. In general, each project is a set of articles that explain the inception and development of a particular idea until it concludes into a functional prototype. These projects range from small web-apps and arduino libraries, to experimental model aircraft that act as concept demonstrators. 

The blog follows a similar structure but focuses on narrating experiences and analyzing them. Here you can find things like miscellaneous rumination, a travel diary, and a research log.

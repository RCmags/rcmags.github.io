Hi! I'm a mechanical engineer and this site is dedicated to documenting my personal projects. They're mostly about model aircraft, but there's some programing projects as well. Complementing this are my post on [RCGroups](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/member.php?u=189488), so check them out!  

Here's some of my stuff:

# :star2: Website for blog and projects 

This site is built using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and its default [minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). Aside from the search bar which is powered by [lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/), there's no use of javascript and all the functionality is achieved through CSS and HTML. 

## :interrobang: Content
This site meant as a repository to display my projects and a place to host my blog. There's no real theme to the content besides, well, whatever is on it. Still, it provides an overview of what I like to work on.  

Thanks __random internet person__ :skull: for being a creeper and taking an interest in what I do! :sweat_smile:

I"è<p>Hi, I‚Äôm a mechanical engineer that‚Äôs learned how to program. I‚Äôve gained this skill over time as I enjoy working on electro-mechanical devices. A lot of this was motivated by my interest unusual radio-controlled aircraft, although with time I‚Äôve delved into robotics and this has become it‚Äôs own motivation. Overall, I‚Äôm very interested in developing and experimenting with unusual small-scale vehicles. They require a combination of mechanics, electronics, and programming that I find very satisfying.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs pictures of some the stuff I have worked on:</p>

<p>This project concerns itself with developing a helicopter rotor that can automatically enter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autorotation">autorotation</a>. Most helicopters transition between powered by and unpowered flight through active control inputs from the pilot. The blades are set at a positive pitch angle in powered flight to produce lift. The blades are set to a much lower or negative pitch angle in autorotation to generate lift.</p>

<p><img src="/img/torque_rotor/rotor-pitch.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>These changes in pitch can be accomplished automatically by using the torque acting on the rotor to dictate the pitch it requires to ensure lift. This is because, in powered flight, the rotor absorbs torque applied to it by a motor, while in autorotation, it is spun by the lift of the blades and there is little to no torque. This asymmetry in torque allows one to differentiate between both states.</p>

<p>It must be mentioned that much of this project is inspired by the simplicity of the rotor of a radio-controlled autogyro. It is nothing more than a strap bolted onto a bearing housing in its simplest case. The blades attach to the strap, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04tJmP2aqcw">cyclic pitch</a> is accomplished by bending the strap. For part of the cycle the strap bends, and for the remaining half, it pitches the blades.</p>

<p>Given the simplicity of this design, it makes it very appealing for use in a helicopter. While an autogyro does not need to adjust the blades’ pitch angle to fly, it is much more important for a helicopter. Moreover, collective allows a rotor to transition from a powered state with a positive pitch to an unpowered state with zero or a negative pitch. This is generally accomplished through a swashplate controlling the blades.</p>

<p>As is evident, the mechanical complexity of a helicopter rotor with cyclic and collective is far more complex than the flexplate used by an autogyro. It is very appealing to allow the simple flexplate design to permit collective changes while maintaining its simplicity.</p>

<h1 id="initial-design-concept">Initial design concept</h1>
<p>The overall concept is to use the torque acting on the rotor to change the pitch angle of the blades. When the motor is on, it applies torque to the rotor, twisting the blades to a positive pitch angle. There is no torque when the motor shuts off, and the blades return to a negative pitch angle for autorotation. An important inspiration for this concept is the <a href="https://www.modlabupenn.org/wp-content/uploads/paulos_an_underactuated_propeller_IROS_2013.pdf">underactuated rotor</a> developed at the University of Pennsylvania:</p>

<p align="center">Video 1. Underactuated rotor cyclic</p>

<p>While this design is intended to generate cyclic changes in the pitch of the blades, the concept is still valid for collective changes. Mainly, one can exploit motor torque to pitch the blades. For cyclic control, the torque that causes the blades to lead and lag is the relative inertia between the blades and the motor. The motor accelerates faster than the blades, rotating relative to the skewed hinges. However, centrifugal forces resist this relative rotation, so the motor reaches an equilibrium deflection.</p>

<p><img src="/img/torque_rotor/hinge-accel.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the skewed hinge used for cyclic control will not work for collective pitch. In this case, the force driving the lag of the blades is aerodynamic drag. Ideally, this force is kept very small to minimize the power drawn by the rotor. Consequently, the scant drag force barely deflects the blades as centrifugal force is much larger.</p>

<p><img src="/img/torque_rotor/hinge-drag.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The solution for the lack of deflection is to amplify the torque generated by drag. Even if the drag is small, it can still generate a large torque with the right mechanism. A simple approach is to use a conrod connected to a lever that twists the blades. By making the lever shorter, the force acting on the conrod is amplified, and this greater force can generate a larger torque at the blades.</p>

<h1 id="design-iterations">Design iterations</h1>
<p><strong>Iteration 1:</strong><br />
The first version of the helicopter did not have a collective pitch. Rather, the blades were set at a positive pitch angle, and the rotor RPM was varied to control altitude. Such a rotor is very simple and allows the aircraft’s flight characteristics to be fine-tuned. Mainly how stable and controllable it is about all three rotational axes. The yaw axis was expected to have robust control as it worked by changing the speed of a lightweight propeller. However, the pitch and roll axes were ambiguous due to a gimballed rotor’s delayed response. This lag may have been enough to make the helicopter unflyable.</p>

<p>Upon testing the aircraft, it was obvious it needed <a href="http://localhost:4000/aircraft/2021/09/26/heli_flight_controller.html">augmented stability</a> to be flyable. Once this was added, the helicopter was quite controllable, although still with a noticeable lag in its controls. Despite this, it was possible to fine-tune the flight control to achieve adequate control, both in a hover and forward flight.</p>

<p><strong>Iteration 2:</strong><br />
The second iteration of the aircraft employed a self-adjusting robot. The first version of the rotor was extremely simple and used string instead of conrods to transfer loads. While this worked, it placed large torque loads about the flexible strap carrying the blades. Nonetheless, while the load distribution left much to be desired, it did prove that a torque-compliant rotor was feasible.</p>

<p align="center">Video 2A. Initial test of concept</p>

<p>Upon test flying the aircraft, it became obvious that altitude control was much faster. Collective changes allow the aircraft to respond rapidly without the lag of waiting for the rotor to spool up. Moreover, since the collective increased with motor torque, the rotor tended to maintain a similar RPM as the changes in pitch acted like a governor in a <a href="https://www.boldmethod.com/learn-to-fly/aircraft-systems/how-a-constant-speed-prop-works/">constant speed propeller</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Iteration 3:</strong><br />
The next iteration of the aircraft refined the rotor design by replacing the strings with rigid linkages and adding ball bearings. While more complex, these modifications made it much easier to adjust the <a href="https://www.rchelicopterfun.com/blade-tracking.html">tracking on the blades</a> to minimize vibrations.</p>

<p align="center">Video 2B. String replaced with rigid linkage</p>

<p><strong>Iteration 4:</strong><br />
At this point, the torque-compliant rotor had been shown to work, and all that was left was to improve the cyclic response. The apparent lag was caused by the aircraft accelerating slowly for a given cyclic input. The acceleration could be increased by two means: reducing the <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mi.html">moment of inertia</a>, or increasing the distance between the rotor thrust vector and the center of mass. The airframe was rebuilt to incorporate these changes. To this end, the servos were placed at a lower position on the rotor mast, the rotor mast was extended, and the electronic components were grouped near the bottom of the mast.</p>

<p align="center">Closeup of electronics</p>

<p>Besides a new airframe, the rotor was modified to have the conrods push rather than pull to spin the rotor. This modification resulted in better loads on the conrods as the threads inside the sockets did not have to resist a large tension force. The modification also changed the way the blades twisted. As the pitch angle increases, the conrods have a smaller angle relative to the lever arm connected to the blade. The resulting feedback loop naturally limits the maximum pitch angle of the blades.</p>

<p align="center">Video 3. Second iteration of rotor</p>

<p>These changes greatly improved the performance of the helicopter. The cyclic control was noticeably faster, and rotor vibrations seemed to have been reduced. While the control response was not as fast as that found in a helicopter equipped with a swashplate, it was still acceptable for all flight conditions.</p>

<p align="center">Video 4. Flight performance of improved rotor</p>

<p>After the helicopter was tuned to achieve adequate flight, autorotation was investigated. In practice, this was nothing more than piloting the aircraft to a large altitude and then shutting off the motor. As expected, the aircraft was able to transition smoothly into autorotation. The rotor kept spinning, and the aircraft settled into a steady-state descent. Unfortunately, friction from the motor caused the fuselage to rotate very quickly during autorotation. The tail rotor could not stop the rotation as it could only apply force in one direction.</p>

<p align="center">Video 5. Demonstration of auto-rotation</p>

<p>In light of this behavior, future iterations of the aircraft should employ a large vertical stabilizer. While this will not prevent the aircraft from rotating in vertical descent, it will stop the rotation with modest forward velocity. In practice, this additional airspeed decreases the descent rate, which is also beneficial.</p>

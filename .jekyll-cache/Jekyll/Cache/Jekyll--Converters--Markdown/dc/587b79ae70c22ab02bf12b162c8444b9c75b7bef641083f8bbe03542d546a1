<p>For an airplane to maintain stable flight, it must have the ability to self-correct in the face of external disturbances. When this occurs, the aircraft must cause the disturbance to decrease with time. We can refine this concept by seperating it into two components: <a href="https://ocw.tudelft.nl/wp-content/uploads/Hand-out-Stability_01.pdf">static stability</a> and <a href="https://www.aircraftflightmechanics.com/Dynamics/ModesofMotion.html">dynamic stability</a>. As the names imply, <em>static stability</em> is concerned with the forces acting on the aircraft in the absence of motion. That is, whether the forces acting on the aircraft reach <a href="https://physicscourses.colorado.edu/phys1110/phys1110_fa12/LectureNotes/StaticEquilibrium.pdf">static equilibrium</a> and mutually oppose each other out. <em>Dynamic stability</em> is focused on whether the aircraft will slow down if pushed away from this equilibrium.</p>

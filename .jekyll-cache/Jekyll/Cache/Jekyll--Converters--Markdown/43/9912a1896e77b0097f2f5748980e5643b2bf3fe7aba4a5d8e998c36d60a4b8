I"Ó<p>This is an Arduino library for ADNS3080 mouse sensor. It provides a simple interface to retrieve motion and frame data from the sensor. It is generally sold as a module with a lens attached. This code was written for such a module. The following schematic shows how to connect the module to an arduino uno. Itâ€™s the same for other boards except the SPI spins change.</p>

<p>To focus the camera see the following repo: <a href="https://github.com/RCmags/ADNS3080_frame_capture">ADNS3080_frame_capture</a>. It contains an arduino sketch and a python script that work in conjunction with this library.</p>

<p>Credit goes to Lauszus and Neumi for on their code to get the sensor to work with arduino. This library is essentially a repackaging of their code into a neater form.<br />

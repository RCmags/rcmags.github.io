<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithopter">Ornithopters</a> are aircraft that use oscillating wings to stay aloft. Depending on the characteristics of the aircraft, an ornithopter can maintain flight at a constant velocity like a bird, or it can fly in static air like an insect. These scenarios are analogous to an airplane driven by a propeller and a helicopter at hover.</p>

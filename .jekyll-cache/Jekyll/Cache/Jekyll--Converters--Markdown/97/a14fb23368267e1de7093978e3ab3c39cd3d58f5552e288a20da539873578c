<p>For an airplane to maintain stable flight, it must have the ability to self-correct in the face of external disturbances. When this occurs, the aircraft must cause the disturbance to decrease with time. We can refine this concept by seperating it into two components: <a href="https://ocw.tudelft.nl/wp-content/uploads/Hand-out-Stability_01.pdf">static stability</a> and <a href="https://www.aircraftflightmechanics.com/Dynamics/ModesofMotion.html">dynamic stability</a>. As the names imply, <em>static stability</em> is concerned with the forces acting on the aircraft in the absence of motion. That is, whether the forces acting on the aircraft reach <a href="https://physicscourses.colorado.edu/phys1110/phys1110_fa12/LectureNotes/StaticEquilibrium.pdf">static equilibrium</a> and mutually oppose each other out. <em>Dynamic stability</em> is focused on whether the aircraft will slow down if pushed away from this equilibrium.</p>

<p>With these definitions, we can notice that dynamic stability depends on static stability. Static stability ensures there is some kind of equilibrium state, and dynamic stability ensures the aircraft can return to it. We can also observe an aircraft has multiple axes about which it can be stable. It can translate about three perpendicular directions and it can rotate about these sames axes:</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_principal_axes">See: Aircraft principal axes</a></p>

<p>Because the aircraft can move in six different directions, there are different ways these motions can combine to yield converging or diverging trajectories. These trajectories are known as <a href="https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/mae5070/DynamicStability.pdf">modes of stability</a> and they determine the behavior of an uncontrolled aircraft. We can best understand these modes by watching them occur and then analyzing them through diagrams.</p>

<p align="center"> Video 1. Modes of stability </p>

<p>Out of these possible trajectories, let us focus on the <em>longitudinal stability</em> of the aircraft, and in particular the <em>short period mode</em>. This mode can be understood as the “springyness and damping” of the aircraft with respect to angle of attack. Video 1 shows behavior at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFWfrmjAQxY&amp;t=173s">2:53 minute</a> mark. This is caused by a restoring torque that rotates the aircraft about the pitch axis. If this torque is sufficiently strong, it will ensure that the aircraft maintains static and dynamic stability.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-static-stability-and-vs-dynamic-stability/">See: Difference between static and dynamic stability</a></p>

<p>Ultimately, it’s not important how the stabilizing torque is generated. It can be obtained by either <em>passive</em> or <em>active</em> means. Whatever the case, both methods have the same effect on longitudinal stability but they have different effects on the lift and drag characteristics of the aircraft.</p>

<h1 id="passive-stability">Passive Stability</h1>
<p>It is possible to use the structure of the aircraft and its mass distribution to passively induce stability. To accomplish this, the center of mass of an aircraft must be located <em>infront</em> of its center of lift. This allows the lift to have a moment arm with respect to the center of mass. The result is that whenever the angle of attack changes, the change in lift tends to twist the aircraft away from the rotation. We can think of as a tendency of the airplane to <em>weathervane</em> into the airflow. In an conventional configuration with a tailplane and a wing, this effect can be understood by looking at the lift acting on the tail. The more lift it produces, the more it torques the fuselage.</p>

<p><img src="/img/figures/wing_tailplane.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>In an alternative configuration, we can move the tail forward until it merges with the wing. In this case we reach what is known as a <a href="https://boernerc.org/resources/FlyingWing">reflexed airfoil</a>. No Longer does the tail keep the nose aloft, but rather the aft portion of the airfoil provides this function.</p>

<p><img src="/img/figures/reflex_airfoil_low.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately there is a large tradeoff with this configuration. Due to the upwards bent trailing edge, there is a decrease in the lift generated by the wing. This is worsened if the trailing edge is controlled like a flap. If the flap is raised to provide more reflex, it will generate a downwards force near the trailing edge that will rotate the airfoil to a higher angle of attack. This greater angle, in turn, forces the airfoil to produce more lift with a shape that is <em>worse</em> at producing additional lift.</p>

<p><img src="/img/figures/reflex_airfoil_high.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Evidently this is a highly inefficient situation. It is especially bad during turns or low speed flight as the wing must operate at high angles of attack. In these situations, an aircraft needs <em>additional</em> lift in order to stay aloft. Despite these problems, a reflexed airfoil is still a viable way to stabilize an airplane.</p>

<p align="center"> Video 2. Demonstration of reflexed airfoil </p>

<h1 id="active-stability">Active Stability</h1>
<p>The inefficiency of a reflexed airfoil can be side-stepped by moving the center of mass aft. This allows the flap to be deflected downwards rather than upwards to maintain static equilibrium. Unfortunately, this configuration is unstable as the aerodynamic center is infront of the center of mass.</p>

<p><img src="/img/figures/cambered_airfoil_low.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>We can oppose the instability by <em>forcing</em> the aircraft to be stable by adjusting the rear flap. With a sufficiently large deflection, the flap can force the airfoil to rotate into the airflow, despite the front of the airfoil wanting to do the opposite.</p>

<p><img src="/img/figures/cambered_airfoil_high.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>This configuration has the advantage that the flap must deflect downward with greater angle of attack to maintain equilibrium. The additional camber is helpful as it <em>enhances</em> the lift generated by the larger angle. This positive relationship is also beneficial at lower angles as it tends to increases the <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/ldrat.html">lift-to-drag ratio</a> of the entire aircraft. To everyone’s advantage, there are a few examples of this kind of actively stabilized airplane available on the internet. While the details of each project vary, the underlying concept is much the same: obtain stability through active deflections of the rear flap and move the center of mass aft.</p>

<h1 id="preliminary-concept">Preliminary concept</h1>
<p>Inspired by the above aircraft, this project concerns itself with the development of an actively stabilized airplane using inexpensive equipment. The design consists of two high speed servos, an arduino nano, a potentiometer, and a foam airframe. The potentiometer is used as an angle of attack sensor and is connected to the arduino. The arduino then uses this signal to control a set of servos connected to the control surfaces. Whenever the sensor measures a change in angle, the arduino commands the servos to deflect the control surfaces and stabilize the aircraft.</p>

<p>The simplest angle-of-attack sensor is a <a href="https://www.ilmailu.org/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=5147.0;attach=10336">simple low-friction potentiometer attached to a weathervane</a>. As the weathervane will closely follow the local airflow, it can be used as a reference from which to measure the angle of attack. Likewise, the arduino can be programmed to use the analog signal from the A.O.A. sensor as the proportional term of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">PID controller</a>. By adjusting the appropriate coefficients, the static and dynamic stability of the aircraft can be greatly enhanced.</p>

<h1 id="design-iterations">Design iterations</h1>

<p><strong>Iteration 1:</strong></p>

<p>The first version of the aircraft was designed to have <em>passive stability</em>. The idea was to enhance its stability electronically and use this <em>excess</em> stability to move the center of mass aft. This would make it easy progressively move the mass and observe the behavior of the aircraft. Eventually the mass would move aft enough to cause the aircraft to depend on the active stabilization. As a consequence, the flaps would deflect downwards to maintain equilibrium.</p>

<p>The aircraft was also equipped with a motor and a propeller so it could fly under its own power. However, this made it difficult to place the angle of attack sensor. The local airflow felt by the sensor is greatly affected by its location on the aircraft. Any regions behind the wing are disturbed by the large <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/downwash.html">downwash</a>, and anything behind the propeller is affected by the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node86.html">powerful slipstream</a>. A simple solution was to place the sensor atop a long vertical stabilizer. If the stabilizer was tall enough, the sensor would lie outside the slipstream of the propeller. Likewise, any lift caused by the fin would be perpendicular to the rotation of the sensor. This would minimize any effects it had on the measured angle.</p>

<p><img src="/img/figures/sensor_airstream.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The angle of attack sensor was very simple. The weathervane was a stick with a fin in the rear and a weight in the front. It was nessesary to ensure the vane was balanced about the axis of the potentiometer to eliminate any inertial effects. If this were not the case, gravity and lateral accelerations would bias the measurement. The lever arm of the vane also had to be large enough to ensure the fin could overcome the friction of the potentiometer. To reduce this friction, the viscous grease on the shaft of the potentiometer was removed with a solvent. This allowed the sensor to respond sufficiently quickly at the airspeeds encountered in flight.</p>

<p><img src="/img/figures/aoa_sensor.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Here is what the completed airplane looked like:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RCmags/TailLessStability/main//example_pictures/top_view_res.jpg" alt="image" />

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RCmags/TailLessStability/main//example_pictures/side_view_res.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, when the aircraft was tested it had obvious problems. First, the thrustline was far below the center of mass. This caused the aircraft to lift its nose to the point it was very difficult to recover. Secondly, the response of the elevons about the pitch axis was rather sluggish. While not a unrecoverable condition, it did make piloting the aircraft somewhat uncomfortable. Despite this, when the motor was shut off, the airplane was capable of gliding without active stabilization. This indicated there was an ample margin of passive stability.</p>

<p><strong>Iteration 2:</strong></p>

<p>For the second iteration, the thrustline of the aircraft was rotated so the prop did not generate a moment with respect to the center of mass. This was accomplished by tilting the firewall of the motor by a fixed angle. After a process of trial and error where the motor was run at full throttle and the fuselage allow to enter free fall, it was possible to align the motor so the thrust did not generate a noticesable torque about the pitch and yaw axes.</p>

<p><img src="/img/figures/thrustline_side.jpg" alt="image" />
<img src="/img/figures/thrustline_top.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The elevons were also made twice as large to increase the control authority and reduce lag in the control response. By extending the surfaces aft, not only did the area grow, but their lever arm with respect to the center of mass was also increased.</p>

<p><img src="/img/figures/larger_flap_top.jpg" alt="image" />
<img src="/img/figures/larger_flap_bottom.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>These modifications greatly enhanced the stability of the aircraft. Changes in throttle had a neutral effect on the attitude and the pitch response was much faster. With the basic airframe complete, the next step was to adjust the PID controller and observe its effects on stability.</p>

<p><em>PID tuning:</em><br />
The first term to be adjusted was the proportional gain. At low settings it had a negligible effect on stability, but as the gain increased the aircraft rotated more slowly for a given elevator command. The control response was also slighly faster. However, after a certain ammount of gain the aircraft would shake quickly if it gained enough airspeed. Seeing this unstable behavior, the gain was set to a value slightly below this threshold.</p>

<p>Next the derivate gain was adjusted. This had a similar effect to the proportional gain. It tended to slow down the rotation of the aircraft and made the response “crisper”. That is, the aircraft settled to its new state with very little if any vissible wobbling. Like before, the derivative gain would cause instability at higher speeds, so its value was limited by this instability threshold.</p>

<p>Last was the integral gain. Unlike the previous terms that noticeable improved the resistance of the aircraft to pitch disturbances, this term didn’t seem to do this. Rather, at low values the integral term did very little, and at higher gains it induced a very strong delay in the control response. It caused the aircraft to become unwieldly to pilot, as prolonged control inputs caused the aircraft to stay rotating for a period of time. Due to this response, the integral term was dissabled.</p>

<p><em>Shifting weight aft:</em><br />
Having obtained an adequate level of excess stability, it was possible destabilize the aircraft by moving the weight aft. This was accomplished by taping a coin to the tail. Unfortunately, test flights showed it was only possible to shift the mass by a moderate ammount. If the tail was too heavy, the active stabilization was incapable of keeping the aircraft aloft.</p>

<h1 id="arduino-code">Arduino Code</h1>
<p>The program is designed to receive 2 PWM inputs from an RC receiver and an analog signal, and outputs two PWM signals for two servos. It is assumed the aircraft is controlled with two elevons. It was written for an Arduino Nano but it should be compatible with other boards. It requires the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/pinchangeinterrupt/">PinChageInterrupt</a> library.</p>

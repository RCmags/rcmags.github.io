I"ð<p>This is a program that attempts to simulate a meteor around a planet through the windows console. 
The code uses the <a href="https://www.programmingsimplified.com/c/conio.h">conio.h</a> library to move the cursor and change the text color.
Itâ€™s fairly simple to use and has a small menu that is executed at the start of the program. 
In case the the meteor reaches the boundary of the console, 
it will elastically collide the boundary and continue to bounce around the confined space.</p>

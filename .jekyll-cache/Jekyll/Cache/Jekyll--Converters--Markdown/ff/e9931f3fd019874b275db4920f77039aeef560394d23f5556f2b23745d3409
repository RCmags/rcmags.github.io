I"d<p>Hi I’m Raul. I’m a mechanical engineer that’s learned how to program. 
I’ve gained this skill over time as I enjoy working on electro-mechanical devices.
A lot of this was motivated by my interest unusual radio-controlled aircraft,
although with time I’ve delved into robotics and this has become it’s own motivation.</p>

<p>Overall, I’m very interested in developing and experimenting with unusual small-scale vehicles. 
They require a combination of mechanics, electronics, and programming that I find very satisfying.</p>

<p>This website is dedicated to organizing and documenting my personal projects.
They’re mostly related to model aircraft and small robots, but there’s a few programming projects as well. 
A lot of my work is also posted on <a href="https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/member.php?u=189488">RCGroups</a> so check it out.</p>

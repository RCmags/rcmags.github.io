<p>Ornithopters are aircraft that use oscillating wings to stay aloft. Depending on the characteristics of the aircraft, it is possible for an ornithopter to maintain flight a constant velocity like a bird. It is also possible for an ornithopter to hover in still air like an insect. Both of these scenarios are analogous to an airplane driven by a propeller and a helicopter hovering in the air.</p>

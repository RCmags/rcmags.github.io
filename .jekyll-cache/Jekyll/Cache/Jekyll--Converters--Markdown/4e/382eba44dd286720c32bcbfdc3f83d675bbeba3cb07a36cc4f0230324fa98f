I"[<p>Hi, I’m a mechanical engineer that’s learned how to program. I’ve gained this skill over time as I enjoy working on electro-mechanical devices. A lot of this was motivated by my interest unusual radio-controlled aircraft, although with time I’ve delved into robotics and this has become it’s own motivation. Overall, I’m very interested in developing and experimenting with unusual small-scale vehicles. They require a combination of mechanics, electronics, and programming that I find very satisfying.</p>

<p>Here’s pictures of some the stuff I have worked on:</p>

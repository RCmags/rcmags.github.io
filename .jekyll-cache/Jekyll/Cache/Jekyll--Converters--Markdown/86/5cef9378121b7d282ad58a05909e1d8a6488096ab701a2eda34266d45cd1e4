I"ß<p>Hi, Iâ€™m a mechanical engineer thatâ€™s learned how to program. Iâ€™ve gained this skill over time as I enjoy working on electro-mechanical devices. A lot of this was motivated by my interest unusual radio-controlled aircraft, although with time Iâ€™ve delved into robotics and this has become itâ€™s own motivation. Overall, Iâ€™m very interested in developing small unusual vehicles. They require a combination of mechanics, electronics, and programming that I find very satisfying. Hereâ€™s a sample of some of the stuff Iâ€™ve worked on:</p>

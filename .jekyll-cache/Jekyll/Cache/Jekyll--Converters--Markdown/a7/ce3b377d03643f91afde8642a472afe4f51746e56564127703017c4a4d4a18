I"á<p>Helicopters are naturally unstable aircraft. If they do not have a system that augments their stability, they will inevitably spiral into the ground. Luckily, there are a few ways to enhance their stability. A classic approach is to use a heavy bar placed at an angle relative to the rotor blades. Such a system is known as a flybar, stabilizer-bar or stabilizer gyro. For helicopters with more than two blades, the bar transforms into a star-shaped object, or even a disk.</p>

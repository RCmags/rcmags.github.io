I"'<p>This is an arduino sketch for a <a href="https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/f2015/dc686_nn233_hz263/final_project_webpage_v2/dc686_nn233_hz263/index.html">self balancing robot</a>. 
This nothing more than a two wheeled platform that is unstable in one direction and must be stabilized to maintain balance.
The code provides the nessesary stabilization through a single MPU6050 gyroscope and does not use of rotary encoders.
Doin so allows the robot to be use inexpensive DC motors controlled through an H-bridge.</p>

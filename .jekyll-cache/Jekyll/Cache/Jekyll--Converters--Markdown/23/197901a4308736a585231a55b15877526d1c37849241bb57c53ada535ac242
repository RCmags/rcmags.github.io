I"‰<p>This is an arduino sketch for a <a href="https://www.electronicshub.org/arduino-line-follower-robot/">line following robot</a> based on infrared LEDâ€™s and an H-bridge. 
The code uses a PID controller to control the wheels of the vehicle so it steers into a dark line. 
To improve the likelihood of the vehicle from sliding off the line, 
the code decreases the speed of the robot when it enters a sharp turn. 
In an effort to improve the low speed performance, 
the speed of the motors is controlled via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-frequency_modulation">pulse frequency modulation</a>.
This allows the motors to be moved under the influence of cogging torque and stiction as the pulses act like a jackhammer.
The end result is motion similar to stepper motor as the motor moves in discrete jumps of variable length.
At higher throttle settings the motors switch over to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a> to smoothen the motion.</p>

<p>The code requires a circuit like the one shown in this schematic:<br />

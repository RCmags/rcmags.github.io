I"‚<p>Hi, Iâ€™m a mechanical engineer thatâ€™s learned how to program. Iâ€™ve gained this skill over time as I enjoy working on electro-mechanical devices. A lot of this was motivated by my interest unusual radio-controlled aircraft, although with time Iâ€™ve delved into robotics and this has become itâ€™s own motivation. Overall, Iâ€™m very interested in developing and experimenting with unusual small-scale vehicles. They require a combination of mechanics, electronics, and programming that I find very satisfying.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s pictures of some the stuff I have worked on:</p>

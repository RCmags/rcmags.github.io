title: "Overview of popular machine learning libraries"
---

The first time I dabbled with machine learning was during college for a undergraduate reasearch assigment. The task was to update some broken code written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/) regarding some aircraft traffic control algorithms. Due to the complexity involved creating trayectories to prevent multiple aircraft from crashing into each other, machine learning was used to figure it out, rather than letting a person deal with the ever growing complexity such a problem can devolve into.

From the perpective of this project as a intruduction to ML, it taught me about the existence of a few libraries/packages that could solve these problems. The python scripts used [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and the Julia scripts used a mixture of [DeepRL](https://github.com/mkschleg/DeepRL.jl), [DeepQLearning](https://github.com/JuliaPOMDP/DeepQLearning.jl), [JuliaML](https://github.com/JuliaML), [Flux](https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/), and probably some other stuff I've forgotten. At the time I didn't understand any of these libraries, and even less how they worked or what they did, so needless to say I completely failed to fix the code. Despite that, this experience served as an improvised self-taught introduction to machine learning. I admit, initially I also felt ML was a bit of a fad and wasn't interested in getting caught up that wave of popularity. 
 
Still, it made sense to learn more about this topic as the last time left me completely dumbfounded. After stumbling upon __FreeCodeCamps's__ [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/) and completing all the multiple-choice questions the course (there's no code exercises), I vaguely understood that there were a different python packages for machine learning. Among them are: 

- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) 
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)

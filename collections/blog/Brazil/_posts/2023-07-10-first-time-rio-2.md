On our second day in Rio, we decided to visit the iconic [Christ the Redeemer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_the_Redeemer_(statue)) Monument. According to the internet, it was fairly close to **Morro da Urca**, which we had explored the day before.  Next to the avenue we needed to cross to reach Morro da Urca, there was a bifurcation. If you took the other road, it led to the entrance of the Redeemer monument, nestled among the mountains of Rio. I suggested taking a bus to the monument, as I thought we would get a better perspective of the city. Buses often travel through various neighborhoods before reaching their destination. A quick online search revealed a bus stop just a couple of blocks from our hostel. At that location, we found a large bus station where we could catch a bus to the monument. Since the bus terminal was nearby, we decided to walk instead of taking a cab or another bus. This turned out to be a great decision; walking allowed us to experience the city at ground level, appreciating our surroundings in a way we wouldn’t have in a vehicle. Interestingly, our hostel was located near a large stadium, which during [Carnival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Carnival) becomes flooded with people and is one of the main event venues in Rio.

The stadium was conveniently located next to a major avenue that led us to another large avenue toward the bus station. As we walked along, we admired the well-maintained buildings, some of which showcased historical architecture or vibrant murals. The streets were not very crowded, and everything had a calm, relaxed vibe. Surprisingly, traffic was light, especially since we left the hostel early, around 8 o'clock in the morning. Upon reaching the bus station, we discovered it wasn't a large building; instead, most buses were parked along the side of the avenue in a designated area. It was interesting to see how part of the avenue was dedicated to bus traffic.

After wandering around the city, the bus dropped us off at the base of a hill, and we had to walk up to reach the entrance of the Christ monument. This area felt more upscale, with well-kept buildings and large houses surrounded by walled gardens. While there were a few taller buildings, most did not exceed three stories. When we arrived at what we thought was the entrance, we realized it was actually the lower station of a small train that took visitors up the mountain to the Christ Monument. We were on our way to the [Concorvado](https://www.tremdocorcovado.rio/) mountain, where the monument is situated. The name translates to "humpback mountain," which is fitting, as its shape resembles that of the _Morro da Urca_. We waited for a long time to board the train, but once we did, the ride was pleasant. The incline of the hill was impressive; the seats of the train were physically rotated to accommodate the slope. It was fascinating to see the diverse group of people on board, as this renowned tourist attraction draws visitors from around the world. Despite this diversity, I noticed that many tourists were from other _Latin American_ countries or _European nations_. Eventually, we reached the train's final stop and had to hike up the mountain to get to the monument.

Upon reaching the monument, we were greeted by a small commercial area filled with shops and benches. Adjacent to this area was a staircase leading up to the monument itself. Unsurprisingly, the entire space was packed with tourists. Although it was challenging to find a quiet spot, we eventually managed to take in the breathtaking scenery below. We were fortunate to have a beautiful, sunny day, with a clear blue sky and only a few clouds. From this vantage point, we could even see Morro da Urca, where we had spent the previous day. At that moment, the true scale of Rio de Janeiro became apparent. The city itself isn't very large; while the metropolitan area spans a vast expanse, the city is just a small part of it. After soaking in the sights, we took the train back down to the base of the Concorvado.

Once we were back in the city, we took a bus to find a shopping center. This led us to a large park surrounded by numerous small stores. There was noticeably more traffic here, even though it wasn't a tourist attraction. Personally, I found this to be a more authentic glimpse of daily life in the city. The park was clean, and locals were going about their day. The shopping center we found had several nice cafés and a large supermarket. As expected, the supermarket offered a variety of goods familiar to any grocery store. It’s amusing how little these establishments change from country to country. We took the opportunity to buy some food for the hostel and tried out the famous [catupiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catupiry) cream cheese.

We spent some time walking around this part of town, appreciating how the atmosphere changed as night fell. The city felt lively and relaxed, with people out searching for restaurants and the streets beautifully lit. Eventually, we grew tired of wandering and made our way back to the hostel, where we cooked some shrimp we had bought at the supermarket and relaxed for the rest of the night.

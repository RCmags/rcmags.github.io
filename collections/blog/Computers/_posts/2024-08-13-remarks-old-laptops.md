For a number of years I had the misforture of using a very slow laptop without knowning any better. What exactly do I mean by this? One of the issues with computers, from a user standpoint, is that performance is relative. You perceive something as "fast" if happens within a timeframe you deem acceptable. For example, In 1995, rending a relatively plain 3D image of a landspace would take hours. 

By comparsion, almost any comercial device in 2024 can recreate that image in much less time. Despite that enourmous increase in computing power, for the people 1995, they through their equipment ran fairly quickly given their expectations of the task. The same effect can happen to anyone if they aren't exposed to something they can qualify as "better". In my case, this lack of perception came about slowly, through the use of very slow Fanless laptop from HP. More specifically, the HP15-223fm:

It sported a mighty Celeron N3050 processor, 4gb of single channel RAM, and a 500gb 5200RPM hard drive. For 2005, the performance of this device would have been noteworthy, especially given its size and the __very low__ power consumption of the processor (only 6W TDP). In that era, a similar processor would easily consume 65W. That's a tremedous difference of power draw for the similar computational power.

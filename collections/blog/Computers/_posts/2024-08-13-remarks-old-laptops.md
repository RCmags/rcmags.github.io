For a number of years I had the misforture of using a very slow laptop without knowning any better. What exactly do I mean by this? One of the issues with computers, from a user standpoint, is that performance is relative. You perceive something as "fast" if happens within a timeframe you deem acceptable. For example, In 1995, rending a relatively plain 3D image of a landspace would take hours.

By comparsion, almost any comercial device in 2024 can recreate that image in much less time. Despite that enourmous increase in computing power, for the people 1995, they through their equipment ran fairly quickly given their expectations of the task. The same effect can happen to anyone if they aren't exposed to something they can qualify as "better". In my case, this lack of perception came about slowly, through the use of very slow Fanless laptop from HP. More specifically, the [HP15-f223wm](https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/product-specs/hp-15-f200-notebook-pc-series/model/8857447):

It sported a mighty [Celeron N3050](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/87257/intel-celeron-processor-n3050-2m-cache-up-to-2-16-ghz.html) processor, 4gb of single channel RAM, and a 500gb 5200RPM hard drive. For 2005, the performance of this device would have been noteworthy especially given its size and the __very low__ power consumption of the processor (only 6W TDP). In that era, a similar processor would easily consume __110W__, for example, the [AMD opteron 170](https://www.cpu-upgrade.com/CPUs/AMD/Dual-Core_Opteron/170.html):

That's a tremedous difference of power draw for the similar computational power. The celeron (with 14nm lithography) was released in 2015 and the Operton (90nm lithography) in 2005, and the difference in power consumption is tremedous! As I understand it, this huge decrease in power is due to the reduction height between the layers that make up the processors. The thinner layers cut through [lithography](https://inc42.com/glossary/lithography/) means much less heat. 

Technical details aside, for years I used this laptop until I couldn't take how slow it was. How I ever thought it was usable when I bought it is an ode to my ignorance of computers at the time. That aside, I do see the value it represented and how it, in retrospect, taught me to squeeze out the performance of a computer with limited hardware performance. More importantly, it taught me about the impact **light-weight** software has user experience, and how beneficial it is to **optimize** software even if its easy to run. Both of these adjustments will greatly enhance the perceived performance of a device.

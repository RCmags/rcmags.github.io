Sometimes its cool to try out different projects just to see if you can pull them off. One of them happened to be making a battery backup for a laptop. Now, at first this sort of doesn't make sense. Don't laptops already have batteries? Yes, they _generally_ do, but there are times when either the capacity is insufficient, or the battery doesn't work or is too much work to replace. In those cases, what can we do to run the laptop without AC power? Simple! Just "mimick" the power provided by an AC adapter with a battery! 

How exactly can this be done? Batteries differ greatly from AC power supplies. They have variable voltage and need a charging circuit, and the batteries need to be the right size to power the laptop a reasonable time. All of these things are true, but the project itself is not that hard. Here's an example of such a powerbank built by someone else:
